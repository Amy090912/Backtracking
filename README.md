# Backtracking

• Read in a DIMACS format file using C++ in Visual Studio and stored the integer elements in to a 2 Dynamic Vector that contained less than 1024 rows.

• Generated a solution by pushing one integer into a vector each time, and applying backtracking algorithm. The row was satisfied if one of its elements showed in solution vector. If all the rows in 2D vector were satisfied, the problem was solved.

• Applied OpenMP in rows checking to make the program more efficient.
